        <p className='info'>DRAW LEAGUE is a drawing game played in a brewery. It takes 
          about 90 minutes to play. Participants, working in teams or 
          individually, draw pictures based on prompts given in three 
          rounds. A single judge looks at each individual drawing and 
          gives it a score from 1â€”100. The top 3 highest ranked scores 
          totaled from all three rounds win prizes.</p>
